# Restaurant-Review-Prediction
In this project, I'm working with open-source restaurant review data to analyze and classify sentiment. Leveraging the NLTK library, I've implemented two classification models: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Naive Bayes has shown superior performance in categorizing the sentiment of restaurant reviews accurately.
